    "# Predicting Titanic Survival Using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will be using Python machine learning and data science libraries such as Scikit-learn, to try building a machine learning model capable of predicting the survival of someone on the RMS Titanic. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Machine Learning challenge/competition from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n",
    "\n",
    "On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to take the following approach:\n",
    "1. Problem definition\n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",
    "4. Features\n",
    "5. Modelling\n",
    "6. Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given some information (name, age, gender, socio-economic class) of an individual aboard the RMS Titanic, can we predict whether or not they survived the shipwreck?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this analysis was obtained from the Kaggle Titanic competition: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is widely believed to be a subset of the \"Titanic Passenger Survival Data\" originally compiled by Thomas Cason and hosted by the Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that while the data is based on the historical record from Encyclopedia Titanica, it is not an exhaustive list of everyone on board. Specifically, this dataset contains 1,309 records (split into train/test sets) and focuses exclusively on passengers, notably excluding the ~900 crew members who were also aboard the ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we can reach 80% accuracy at predicting whether or not a passenger can survive the shipwreck, I'll submit it to Kaggle haha. Realistically, this would mean successful proof of concept, which can then be refined even futher for real world use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",

    "* **sex**: This records the gender of the passenger.\n",

    "* **fare**: This records the monetary price the passenger paid for their journey.\n",
    "* **cabin**: This lists the specific cabin number assigned to the passenger, though many values are missing.\n",

This is useful in situations where perfectly collinear<br>features cause problems, such as when feeding the resulting data<br>into an unregularized linear regression model.<br><br>However, dropping one category breaks the symmetry of the original<br>representation and can therefore induce a bias in downstream models,<br>for instance for penalized linear classification or regression models.<br><br>- None : retain all features (the default).<br>- 'first' : drop the first category in each feature. If only one<br>  category is present, the feature will be dropped entirely.<br>- 'if_binary' : drop the first category in each feature with two<br>  categories. Features with 1 or more than 2 categories are<br>  left intact.<br>- array : ``drop[i]`` is the category in feature ``X[:, i]`` that<br>  should be dropped.<br><br>When `max_categories` or `min_frequency` is configured to group<br>infrequent categories, the dropping behavior is handled after the<br>grouping.<br><br>.. versionadded:: 0.21<br>   The parameter `drop` was added in 0.21.<br><br>.. versionchanged:: 0.23<br>   The option `drop='if_binary'` was added in 0.23.<br><br>.. versionchanged:: 1.1<br>    Support for dropping infrequent categories.</span>\n",

This is useful in situations where perfectly collinear<br>features cause problems, such as when feeding the resulting data<br>into an unregularized linear regression model.<br><br>However, dropping one category breaks the symmetry of the original<br>representation and can therefore induce a bias in downstream models,<br>for instance for penalized linear classification or regression models.<br><br>- None : retain all features (the default).<br>- 'first' : drop the first category in each feature. If only one<br>  category is present, the feature will be dropped entirely.<br>- 'if_binary' : drop the first category in each feature with two<br>  categories. Features with 1 or more than 2 categories are<br>  left intact.<br>- array : ``drop[i]`` is the category in feature ``X[:, i]`` that<br>  should be dropped.<br><br>When `max_categories` or `min_frequency` is configured to group<br>infrequent categories, the dropping behavior is handled after the<br>grouping.<br><br>.. versionadded:: 0.21<br>   The parameter `drop` was added in 0.21.<br><br>.. versionchanged:: 0.23<br>   The option `drop='if_binary'` was added in 0.23.<br><br>.. versionchanged:: 1.1<br>    Support for dropping infrequent categories.</span>\n",

Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale.
