    "# Predicting Titanic Survival Using Machine Learning\n",
    "**Author:** Justin Zhao\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n",
    "\n",
    "On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is a Machine Learning challenge/competition from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning pipeline used to achieve a top 5% score on the Titanic Kaggle leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "1.  **Preprocessing:** Custom feature engineering (Title extraction, Family size binning) and robust imputation.\n",
    "2.  **Model Selection:** GridSearch tuning of three distinct classifiers:\n",
    "    * **XGBoost** (Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "    * **RandomForest** (Bagging)\n",
    "    * **Logistic Regression** (Linear baseline)\n",
    "3.  **Ensemble:** A `VotingClassifier` to combine predictions and reduce variance.\n",
    "4.  **Conclusion:** Final thoughts and takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given some information (name, age, gender, socio-economic class) of an individual aboard the RMS Titanic, can we predict whether or not they survived the shipwreck?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this analysis was obtained from the Kaggle Titanic competition: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is widely believed to be a subset of the \"Titanic Passenger Survival Data\" originally compiled by Thomas Cason and hosted by the Department of Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that while the data is based on the historical record from Encyclopedia Titanica, it is not an exhaustive list of everyone on board. Specifically, this dataset contains 1,309 records (split into train/test sets) and focuses exclusively on passengers, notably excluding the ~900 crew members who were also aboard the ship."

    "Effective preprocessing was the primary driver of model performance in this project. Rather than throwing all features into the model at once, I adopted an iterative approach: establishing a baseline with simple imputation, and then sequentially adding engineered features to validate their impact on an **XGBoost** model.\n",

    "Below is a summary of the iterative improvements observed during the Exploratory Data Analysis phase.\n",

    "#### **Phase 1: Baseline**\n",
    "* **Strategy:** Basic categorical encoding of features `Sex`. Imputation of `Age` and `Fare` if necessary (not necessary for decision trees)\n",
    "* **Logic:** Establish a control score using only raw numerical data and basic categorical encoding.\n",
    "* **Cross-Validation Score:** `~82.3%`\n",
    "* **AUC:** `~0.84`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Phase 2: Title Extraction**\n",
    "* **Strategy:** Extracted prefixes from the `Name` column (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Master., Dr.). grouped rare titles (Don, Rev, Major) into a single `Rare` category. Clean up noisy/unecessary features such as `Ticket`.\n",
    "* **Logic:** Titles serve as a proxy for social status, gender, and age grouping simultaneously. 'Master' specifically helps identify male children who (unlike adult males) had high survival rates.\n",
    "* **Cross-Validation Score:** `~82.8%`\n",
    "* **AUC:** `~0.86`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Phase 3: Family Survival Rate**\n",
    "* **Strategy:** Calculated family sizes based on `Parch` and `Sibsp`; Calculated the survival rate of groups sharing the same ***Surname*** and `Ticket` price.\n",
    "* **Logic:** Survival was rarely independent; if one family member survived, others were significantly more likely to survive (and vice versa) due to rescue boats keeping groups together.\n",
    "* **Cross-Validation Score:** `~86.7%` *(+3.9% lift)*\n",
    "* **AUC:** `~0.92` *(+0.06 lift)*\n",

    "The issue with the grid searched hyperparameters is that the best cross-validated results still leaned towards overfitting. \n",

    "I had to reduce the size of the hyperparmeter grid and \"force\" models to generalize more by having low max depth, higher min samples for splitting, lower learning rate, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then the final adjustments came from finding parameters which lead to the lowest delta between prediction accuracy on the training split and prediction accuracy on the test split. (High training split accuracy means the model just \"memorized\" the training data).\n",

Features with 1 or more than 2 categories are<br>  left intact.<br>- array : ``drop[i]`` is the category in feature ``X[:, i]`` that<br>  should be dropped.<br><br>When `max_categories` or `min_frequency` is configured to group<br>infrequent categories, the dropping behavior is handled after the<br>grouping.<br><br>.. versionadded:: 0.21<br>   The parameter `drop` was added in 0.21.<br><br>.. versionchanged:: 0.23<br>   The option `drop='if_binary'` was added in 0.23.<br><br>.. versionchanged:: 1.1<br>    Support for dropping infrequent categories.</span>\n",

Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale.

    "## 4. Conclusion & Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrated that **feature engineering and data understanding are the primary drivers of performance**. By moving beyond raw data and creating sociologically relevant features (like *Title* and *Family Survival*), the models were able to capture patterns that raw training missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Feature Importance & Data Strategy\n",
    "* **\"Title\":** One of the most predictive features was the extracted *Title*. It acted as a powerful proxy for Age, Gender, and Social Class simultaneously.\n",
    "* **Redundancy Reduction:** A key lesson was the danger of **multicollinearity**. Training on raw `SibSp` and `Parch` alongside the derived `FamilySize` feature introduced noise. Dropping redundant columns improved model stability.\n",
    "* **Family Survival:** The strongest boost came from grouping passengers by Ticket/Surname. The survival of family is highly predictive, but to the point where it was highly important to ensure models didn't \"overlearn\" and memorize the training data about family survival. In the real testing data, the family survival is commonly unknown. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Model Performance & Tuning\n",
    "* **Tree-Based vs. Linear:** While *XGBoost* and *RandomForest* provided excellent baselines out-of-the-box, *Logistic Regression* proved very strong after feature engineering, tuning, and robustly \"massaging\" the data for it. This suggests that the problem is pretty linear.\n",
    "* **Combating Overfitting:** The small size of the Titanic dataset makes it prone to memorization especially after `Family_Survival` was introduced.\n",
    "    * For **XGBoost** and **RandomForest**, limiting the `max_depth` and increasing samples needed for new trees was critical to reducing the \"memorization\" effect.\n",
    "    * For **LogisticRegression**, it was important to set a high regularization C.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Final Lessons\n",
    "* **Iterative Experimentation:** The best results required a cycle of *Hypothesis -> Feature Creation -> Validation -> Error Analysis*.\n",
    "* **Tool Stack Mastery:** This project solidified my understanding of the entire ML lifecycle—from using `pandas` for data manipulation to building custom `sklearn` pipelines for training models, and evaluating them.\n",
    "* **Domain Knowledge:** A key realization was that survival probability was determined by social hierarchies (Title, Sex, Class) and family structures. By helping to encode this domain knowledge into the dataset, I bridged the gap between human intuition and machine learning. This shows how the most powerful models are those that combine rigorous statistical tuning with a deep understanding of the problem."
